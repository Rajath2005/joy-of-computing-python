# A basic "for" loop to print a statement multiple times
for i in range(10):
    print("Hi, how are you?")

# The "range" function generates numbers from 0 to 9 (10 times).

# Using a "for" loop with a variable to print numbers and their multiples
answer = 0
for i in range(5):
    answer += i
    print("For I in range 5: answer =", answer)

# The loop adds numbers from 0 to 4 to the "answer" variable.
